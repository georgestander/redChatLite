# RedwoodChat Roadmap

## Timeline
| Plan | Window | Goal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 MVP (current) | 2026-02-12 to 2026-02-25 | Reusable Redwood-first chat package with streaming, attachments, persistence, and resume support | `in_progress` |
| v1.1 (next, draft) | TBD | Post-MVP hardening and expansion (provider breadth, ops tooling, production readiness) | `backlog` |

## Current Plan Progress (v1 MVP)
Completion gate: A row can be `done` only when lint passes, tests pass, and the work is committed.

| Item | Status | Lint | Tests | Commit | Updated At (UTC) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Governance docs baseline (AGENTS/README/CHANGELOG/roadmap/progress tables) | `in_progress` | `not-run` | `not-run` | `pending` | 2026-02-12 | Awaiting commit in repo |
| Product implementation sprint (from `docs/plan.md`) | `todo` | `not-run` | `not-run` | `no` | 2026-02-12 | No code implementation started |

## Future Plan Intake
Add new plan cycles here after planning:
1. Add a timeline row with dates and objective.
2. Add a progress row with completion gates.
3. Link to the corresponding plan doc.
