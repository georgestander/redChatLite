# RedwoodChat Roadmap

## Timeline
| Plan | Window | Goal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 MVP | 2026-02-12 to 2026-02-25 | Reusable Redwood-first chat package with streaming, attachments, persistence, and resume support | `in_progress` |
| v2 UI parity | 2026-02-16 to 2026-03-06 | RedwoodSDK demo with practical AI SDK behavior parity and Vercel-style visual parity | `done` |
| v1.1 hardening | TBD | Provider breadth, ops tooling, production readiness | `backlog` |

## Current Focus
1. Stabilize CI + branch rules around `CI / validate`.
2. Keep demo parity stable as dependencies move.
3. Prepare scoped v1.1 planning inputs.

## Completed v2 Milestones
1. Runtime migration to RedwoodSDK `vite + worker`.
2. Chat behavior parity (send, stop, regenerate, resume, attachments, streaming).
3. Provider streaming parity (OpenAI/OpenRouter adapters).
4. Resume semantics hardening.
5. Vercel-style visual parity pass and UI parity lock tests.

## Next Intake
1. Add v1.1 timeline and acceptance criteria.
2. Add the first v1.1 progress checkpoint once scoped.
